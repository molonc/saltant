API usage
==========

The easiest way to learn the API is by browsing saltant's API reference
at `mwiens91.github.io/saltant`_. [#redoc-spec]_ That said, this
documentation will cover the basics here.

Authentication
--------------

By default you need to be authenticated to access anything on the
API. There are three ways to authenticate:

#. JWT authentication
#. Token authentication
#. Session authentication

**JWT authentication**

    with two relatively unimportant details, which you probably won't
    notice.
